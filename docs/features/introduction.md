# Writing your Markdown docs

This section is intended to give you some tips about how to write your documentation in Markdown, both for consistency and so that it will work well with MkDocs which is used to build the documentation sites in Backstage.
MkDocs uses [Python Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown) to render Markdown documents.

For general support on how to write your documentation, refer to [the Spotify Technical Writing Guide](https://backstage.spotify.net/docs/default/component/technical-writing-guide).
