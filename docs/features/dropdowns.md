# Dropdowns

For optional or additional information, you can use the Details extension to create dropdowns. This way, the content does not clutter your document while being available for curious readers.

Use triple question marks followed by type, for example, info dropdown.

<pre>
??? info dropdown "Troubleshooting this step"
    If you see the following error, or similar… 
</pre>

??? info dropdown "Troubleshooting this step"
    If you see the following error, or similar… 

!!! note
    The result is not shown in the wysiwyg view of your editor, it is constructed when the mkdocs build runs.

For more info, see [Details extension](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/details/).
