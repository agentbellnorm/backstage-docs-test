# Tables

The table syntax is rather simple and is generally only useful for simple tabular data. Note that table cells cannot contain any block level elements and cannot contain multiple lines of text. They can, however, include inline Markdown.

Additionally, a table must be surrounded by blank lines, that is, there must be a blank line before and after the table.
